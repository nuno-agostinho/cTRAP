Description: Compare differential gene expression results with those from known
    cellular perturbations (such as gene knock-down, overexpression or small 
    molecules) derived from the Connectivity Map. Such analyses allow not only 
    to infer the molecular causes of the observed difference in gene expression 
    but also to identify small molecules that could drive or revert specific 
    transcriptomic alterations.
